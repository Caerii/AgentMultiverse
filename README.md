# AssistantHackWeek
Alif Jakir and Ryan Tran's experiments with OpenAI Assistants

# OpenAI Dev Day WeekLong Hack
# 11/8/2023
# Alif Jakir
# Ryan Tran

# Assistants API (free until 11/17/2023)
# Retrieval (free until 11/17/2023)

# Game representation using DALL-E 3
# Generate the scenes of the simulation of the history of the interaction
# Whole world simulation

# From history of the interaction we can synthesize sort of like
# audiobooks kind of situation

# Brainstorm:

# Humor:
- TTS tied with Metahuman
- Epic rap battles between the TTS
    - Zeus
    - Spongebob
    - Minecraft Steve
    - Flying Dutchman
    - Light Yagami
- Livestreaming

# Multi Agent works:
- AI Democracy w/ Assistants?
- Simulation of microeconomics behavior
- Team of Scientists working together to engineer and make the product design

# ThreeJS web stuff
- 2D Canvas in a 3D Scene, with shaders + TTS and (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvfF1YNDrTw&ab_channel=HoustonPublicMedia)

# Data Processing Tools
- Youtube Summarizer (https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt_with_vision_for_video_understanding)

# Augmented Reality
- Semantic understanding of segmented data (https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/) w/ Segment Anything (https://segment-anything.com/)

# Speech Model
- LTU-AS model for speech foundation model


# We have decided to
- AI Town with silly scenarios + AI Play with a Director
    - Episodes
    - Absurd scenarios
    - Generative Characters interacting
    - Parameterization through JSON of structures, scenarios, plots, characters, motives,
    - Events
    - Livestream at a regular time each day, and also specials
    - Map out longitudinal memory decay (realistic memory for agents)
    - Map out environment parameterization
    - Generate 3D Assets: https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/rapidly-generate-3d-assets-for-virtual-worlds-with-generative-ai/
    - AI Images to Meshes for Content Synthesis Pipeline (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBLk4roDTCQ)
